jni4net is used to generate the cs files in the googClosure project.  These files are generated by invoking the run command, which must be execute from a Visual Studio Console, or any other Console that has the cs compiler set in its path.  How I normally do it is that I go to the Start Menu->Program Files->Microsoft Visual Studio 2010->Visual Studio Tools->Visual Studio x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt...  Or whatever other version of Visual Studio you might have.
